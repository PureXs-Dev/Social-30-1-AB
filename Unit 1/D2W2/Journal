////////Economic Liberalism in theory and practice////////

Farming in the 15th to 18 century relied on collectivist values

then someething called enclosure happend
Before enclosure there was alot of common land, land that small famers owned and overall very split.
After enclosure rich farmers and barons owned the farming land.



Enclosure laws benefited the large landowners ( they own more now)
They had unified farms that made them more efficient

Small farmers were forced off their land, often had to sell and work for someone else.
they usually moved into the city.



//////Scientific Agriculture///////

basically more science = more goodies cause they know how to get more of it 
weight of animals and what they produce as well as the efficiency of how crops grow

This combined the industrial revolution to the enclosure.




///////Mercantilist system//////
1500-1700 Europe 
export more goods than import
health of the economy depended on the opression of the working class
if the working class had no extra money, free time or education the mercantile system would make merchants and the governemnt very rich.





//////// Laissez- Faire economics////////
1750 - agiricultural economy moved into an industrial economy because of enclosure 
1770 - a group of economists called the physiocrats emerged - what if there were no gonvernement control or intervention


The origins of laissez- faire economics 

Laissez-faire meaning "leave alone'

adam smith mentioned it in the book " the wealth of nations'
* rejected mercantillism
* the invisable hand - when people work for their own good they made the whole nation better through their hard work
* supply and demand monitored the market


yeah thats about it, just a deeper dive into examples of liberalism
