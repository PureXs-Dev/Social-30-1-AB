This whole topic is about taking what we know at putting it on a spectrum

First we learn what a spectrum is

A way of showing the most radical point of view at its polar opposite and everything in between.

Take good and evil for example

good is on one side of the spectrum and evil is on one side of the spectrum and you can list the things in between.


and all there is are the slides on the ideas that we learned in w1d1 and w1d2 and putting those on a spectrum

if we put a economic spectrum up for discussion

Communism is on the left while Capitalism is on the right and things in between are ideas like democratic socialism, Socialism and other economic ideas like that


IK the notes are short but there isnt all that much

//////UPDATE/////////






We also added individualism and collectivism into a spectrum
